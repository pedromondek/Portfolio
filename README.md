# âœ¨ Features 

### Home Page
- When we enter the site, some "fade-in" and "glitch" animations show the presentation of the site, which is the "Home Page".
- Animated button to scroll down to "About Me Page".

<br>

### Sidebar & About Me Page
- The "About Me" area does not have anything animated yet, so it only has a static part.
- The sidebar has some animations that are always active to give the impression that there is a light running through it.
- The sidebar has animations for expansion and reduction, which also have animations for its content that will be typed and better highlighted when expanded and which obviously also serves for navigation on the site.
